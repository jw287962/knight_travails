## knight_travails

Demonstrates an understanding of tree data structures, and finds the shortest path from two positions through a level order approach, stopping at the first occurence of the final position.
This ultimately shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

The tree structure only calculate all possible combinations to 7 moves, which allows a user to go from any position to another position.

## Board

-- Position starts from bottom left at (0,0), and assumes an (x,y) coordinate system where they represent the horizontal and vertical axis, respectively.

## Guide

Click any position to set the start position, and click another position to choose the end position. That is it!
